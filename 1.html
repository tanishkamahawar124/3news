            Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday sharpened his attack on the Congress in the run-up to the Gujarat polls next month, saying its Bharat Jodo Yatra is not a padayatra (foot march) but a yatra for power without naming Rahul Gandhi, who is leading his party’s biggest public outreach in years from Kanyakumari to Kashmir</p>
            <p>He accused Congress of calling him names and again attacked it over the participation of activist Medha Patkar, who spearheaded the Narmada Bachao Aandolan to prevent the displacement of locals due to the construction of a dam in Gujarat, in the yatra.</p>
